Hello! Please read this text before using this HTML/CSS amazon replica webpage!

Create a folder (You can name it anything)

Place the HTML, CSS and assets.zip file in the root of the newly created folder

Now extract assets.zip

After extracting, open the new assets folder

Inside the assets folder, you will find another assets folder containing all the required images(/assets/assets:)

Cut the assets folder that was inside the previous assets folder and put it inside folder containing the Html and CSS

Now you can delete the extracted assets folder as it must be empty now

Your assets will load succesfully now!

[The webpage is oriented for a Laptop/Computer. You might find bugs in any other device such as a mobile phone or a tab}
